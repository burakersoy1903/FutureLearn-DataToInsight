Follow teachers
--- 1.4 Welcome - please introduce yourself ----------
Howdy, y'all! This is Burak Ersoy. I live in Texas, USA; however, I am from Turkey originally. I work as a business clinical analyst at a children's hospital and I hold a MSc. in Computer Science. With that being said, I am not new in data analytics or technology, but I am new in R and medical statistics. I am very excited to see examples with health data and ready to learn new approaches through this Data to Insight challenge. Thank you!
--- 1.5 How do we use data analysis? ----------
So statistics lets us give an air of objectivity rather than just an opinion.
Even hospitals make clever use of data to cut costs and to keep patients moving through the system. We used data analysis to help the heart unit at Auckland City Hospital fix a bottleneck in their system. This bottleneck was causing nearly 30% of elective heart surgeries to be cancelled at the very last minute. And this wasn't just costly for the hospital, but was also very, very stressful for patients and their families. So we built a model of the patient flow through the intensive-care unit. And we fed into this model all kinds of data: the data of the arrival times of patients, the kind of treatment they needed, how long they spent in the unit. And then also staff rosters and the schedules for elective surgery. And then we used this model to simulate all kinds of "what if?" scenarios-- a whole range of them-- to see what the best way would be to reduce cancellations. The hospital then made some changes and the cancellation rate fell from nearly 30% to 10%.
--- 1.6 The place of data analysis in problem solving ----------
Check "Images\ppdac.png"
The PPDAC model: Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusions
A knowledge-based solution to the real problem requires better understanding of how some things work.
“whipping it into shape” (data cleaning)
The Problem step is about trying to turn these vague feelings into much more precise goals, some very specific questions that should be able to be answered using data.
The formation of conclusions typically involves the analyst and a subject-matter expert (e.g. someone who understands the business) who will “own” the conclusions.
This article has been about purpose-collected data.

--- 1.11 Using iNZight Lite ----------
iNZight Lite is a web-application that runs over the internet and does not need to be installed. It will run on tablets. The user interface for iNZight Lite is rather different from that for iNZight.
--- 1.12 Data organisation ----------
[Comments] I guess in databases, entities are represented in a form of tables during implementation as you said but during design they are referred to as entities in the Entity-Relationship Diagram or Objects if you are using Object-Oriented approach.
Rows and Cells vs. Entities vs Variables (statistical term)
Column header
Data Organisation Format: Rectangular data
Gaps in the data
Missing Value: NULL or NA in iNZight
Different programmes have different default missing-value code conventions.
Numeric Variables vs Categorical Variables (defining groups)
--- 1.13 Week 1 glossary ----------
Frequency: The number of times a value of a variable, or a category, occurs. (Alternative names: count, tally.)
--- 1.14 Using your own data ----------
Some general data preparation rules (10 items)
10. Remove units from data, e.g. 5 years/5 yrs/5yr should all be just 5 and $10 is just 10
--- 1.15 Exercise - Load data into iNZight ----------
Check "Articles\1.15-exercise-import-data-into-R_17.pdf"
Check "100-InstallTheRPackages.R"
--- 1.16 Data Organisation Quiz ----------
Question 1: We arrange our data in a rectangular format where the entities (or individuals) data is being recorded for correspond to the rowsand the variables (or properties being recorded for those entities) correspond to the columns.
Question 2: We collect and analyse data so we can get insight into a problem of interest, make informed decisions rather than guess, and understand what could happen.
Question 3: The missing value in the red dotted circle should be recorded as a 0 or a space. This statement is FALSE – We should represent a missing value using a special code (e.g. NA for iNZight) or the cell should be entirely empty.
Question 4: AgeDecade is a numeric variable. This statement is FALSE – AgeDecade is a categorical variable because age has been divided up into age groups.

Nice comments! :D
First week done!


Week 02 -- 03242018 ------------------------------------------------------------
STATS BOOT CAMP ----------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2.1 Introduction ----------
NHANES (in-hayns) survey data
We'll look at variables like Education, Marital Status, and Body Mass Index.
--- 2.2 Categorical variables ----------
Whenever I get a new data set, I try to familiarise myself with what I've got before I do any real analysis. I look for things that might surprise me and might indicate errors in the data. One of the first things I do is to look at each variable in turn.
Numeric variables are those we can think of as measurements, like Age and Weight here. Categorical variables, like Gender, Age Decade, Race3, Education, and Marital Status give us group membership labels.
A categorical variable like Marital Status divides our people up into categories or groups.
In 2011, NHANES changed their race categories to separate out Asian. It had previously been included in "Other". The name of the new variable is Race3.
Pies and stacked bars have the advantages of conveying the sense of being parts of a whole. However, they're not good for discovery because they're not good at letting you see changes and differences. And spotting changes is the lifeblood of discovery.
We get useful impressions of what the data are saying much more quickly from the graph than from a table of numbers. We look first at the graph to get an impression of what's happening, and then consult the table if we want more accuracy.
--- 2.3 Week 2 glossary ----------
Oddities: Anything in the data that looks strange or odd. Things that make us wonder, “Is that a mistake?”
--- 2.4 Ordering categories ----------
If the categories have a natural ordering, the variable is said to be ordinal.
If there's no natural ordering, the variable is said to be nominal.
If there's no particular reason for setting categories in some other order, ordering them by height order is usually the most informative. We call this ordering by frequency.
Frequency is just another name for a count. 
o wrap up, we have the following ways of ordering. Alphabetic order helps us to locate a particular item in a list just as we do with a name in a phone book. Frequency order is best for letting us see relative popularity. But if there's a natural order, we'd normally want to use it.
--- 2.5 Exercise - Categorical variables ----------
Check "Articles\2.5-exercise-categorical-variables_R_17.pdf"
Check "200-StatsBootCamp.R"
--- 2.6 Categorical variables Quiz ----------
Question 1: Numeric variables are those like Age (in years) that we can think of as measurements. A categorical variable, like AgeDecade, defines groups that our entities belong to.
Question 2: Pie charts are very difficult to use if you want to assess group differences, unless there are only 2 groups. Stacked bar charts make comparisons between different groups difficult. Using percentages gives a clear impression of the order of the groups by size as well as giving a consistent indication of the fraction of all the entities that belong to that group. An ordinal variable is a set of groupings that has a natural order.Nominal variables contain groups that have no natural order and can often usefully be plotted in the order of their frequencies.
Question 3: Chart reading question
Question 4: Chart reading question

Week 02 -- 03262018 ------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2.7 Numeric variables ----------
I'll talk about centre
Plotting numeric variables shows us interesting characteristics of our data.
It's called a stacked dot plot. Each value is plotted against the scale using a dot-- so each dot represents a person.
Insight defaults from drawing dot plots to drawing histograms, like this one, at about 2,000 observations. Histograms are faster to draw for large data sets. But you'll see they're giving us the same shapes to interpret.
Here the main things we look for in dot plots-- centre, spread, shape, and oddities.
When the data is nearly symmetric, the mean and the median are almost the same.
This sort of shape is said to be skewed. With skewed data, there's no sharp notion of centre.
So which measure of centre should we use? That depends on what we want to use it for. For incomes, and many highly-skewed variables, the median tends to be preferable because it better represents the common experience, or what is typical. Half of the people get less. Half get more.
--- 2.8 Features of numeric variables ----------
Check "Articles\2.7-Features of Numeric Variables.pdf"
Centre: Median and Mean
Spread: Interquartile Range (IQR) and Standard deviation
Shape: Modality (unimodal, bimodal, trimodal) and Symmetry and skewness(symmetric, positively and negatively skewed)
Oddities: Outlier(s), Gaps and Clusters, Spike, Truncation, and Truncation with spike
Means can be quite badly affected by outliers in smaller data sets whereas medians are not.
Recall that if the shape is strongly skewed the mean and median can be quite different.
Standard Deviation and Variance: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html
Positive skew = right skew = a longer right tail 
Negative skew = left skew = a longer left tail
How to Find the Median Value: http://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html
Quartiles: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quartiles.html
-- 2.9 Feature spotting ----------
I'll talk about spread, shape, and oddities (good graph examples--I should built them in R if we don't do it in next chapter)
We’ll introduce you to box plots and measures of spread, and to shape and oddities.
When we cut the data in half-- half above, half below-- this gives us the median. The position that divides the bottom half in half-- so that a quarter of the observations lie below, and three-quarters above it-- is the first, or lower, quartile. Similarly, the third, or upper, quartile divides the upper half of the data in half. So that three-quarters lies below, and a quarter of the observations lie above. Circling this gives us the middle half. Putting it together gives us the box plot.
The concept of spread answers the questions-- how spread out are the observations along the scale? Or equivalently, how much did these observations vary?

Check "200-StatsBootCamp.R"
--- 2.11 Numeric variables Quiz ----------
Question 1: The value where our stacked dot plot or histogram balances is the mean. The middle value of the data is the median. 
In statistics “Average” refers to the vague idea of “centre”. “Mean” and “Median” are precise, but different, ways of trying to implement the vague idea of “average”.
Question 2: FALSE:The mean for this data will be very different to the median, due to the shape of the dot plot.
The middle line of the box plot corresponds to the median BPDiaAve.
The dot plot and box plot is reasonably symmetric. The mean and median would be quite similar.
Question 3: FALSE: The median and mean of the number of drinks per day would be very similar.
The data is strongly positively skewed.
--- 2.12 Comparing groups ----------
The most useful insights from data come from spotting an important change.
Shifts vs. Background variability
The extent of a shift
shift and overlap
So high numbers of Children Per Woman seem to be associated with factors that tend to go along with poverty.
I just mean within-group variability. It would probably have been better to express it like that.
‘Shift’ is basically a change (move) in centres. ‘Background variability’ is the variability of values in each group around their centres.

--- 2.16 Comparing groups Quiz ----------
Question 1: TRUE: Europe & Central Asia has the biggest median.
This median is the furthest to the right.
TRUE: Every Region had at least one country with an ALE value over 75 years.
The individual values are the dots. There is at least one dot above 75 years within every Region.
TRUE: There is a lot of overlap in the data for all Regions except Sub Saharan Africa.
There is almost complete overlap between the sets of points for all Regions except Sub-Saharan Africa which is shifted substantially to the left and has at most half overlap with the other Regions.
FALSE: The spread (as summarised by the IQR) for Sub-Saharan Africa is much bigger than for East Asia & Pacific.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s IQR (box width) is similar if not smaller than that for East Asia & Pacific.
Question 2: TRUE: For each Region, the median ALE has been larger in recent years than it was in 1952.
The dot plots for all regions move to the right over the years showing a longer life expectancy.
TRUE: For most Regions, the increases in median ALE have been slowing down over recent years.
The shift from left to right (showing a lengthening of life expectancy) is in smaller increments between years than previously.
FALSE: The variability in ALE has reduced over time for all regions.
For example, the spread of the data for Sub-Saharan Africa has increased since the 1950s
--- 2.17 Questioning strategy in Quizzes and Tests ----------
Most of you are time-poor so we want make sure that every element of the course, including each quiz and test, is aimed at increasing learning.
--- 2.18 Boot Camp assessment ----------
I have no plans to upgrade
Just skip
--- 2.19 Weekly Reflections ----------
Over analyzing data is a trap for young players. Models are best if they are simple, but if you over-analyze the data your model will be very complicated and impossible to explain. It'll also be very hard to use. If you can see that the main relationships are simple, the insight you can get is far more useful for making informed decisions. Gotta be better than guessing!!
