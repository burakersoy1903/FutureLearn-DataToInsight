# tail proportion -- closer to zero better!
# large p-value --> no evidence that there are true treatment-group differences
# small p-value --> does provide evidence that there are true treatment-group differences
# Furthermore, the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that true treatment differences exist.
